					<h1>Hi I'm Vinith</h1>
					<p class="about"> I study at Victoria park Collegiate Institute located in North York. I am currently taking a computer science course. 
					I am a curious student who has many hobbies.I love making websites such as these. Apart from making websites,
					I like to read books, surf the Internet and build models such as airplanes and even small robots. This website is the product of my creativity and hard-work.
					This is one of my very first websites though. So feel free to provide any feed back and opinions.
					I give you my personal assurance that your opinion will be read and taken into account. Call me at 416-4164-1641.
					I hope you have nice day and i hope to see you on my future websites
					Bye.</p>
