					<p>The first thing to keep in mind is that there is no consensus on the definition of dreaming. A general way to think about dreams is that 
					it is an involuntary succession of images, perceptions, emotions and thoughts. Through Oneirology, the study of dreams, we have found that all dreaming occurs during
					REM sleep.<p>

					<p>REM stands for Rapid Eye Movement. During this stage of sleeping, it may seem counterintuitive 
					that the only muscle that moves (for normal people without any sleep disorders) is the eye itself.
					The weird thing about REM sleep is that during this stage the brain's electrical activity almost 
					exactly mimics the electrical activity when the body is awake.</p>

						<p>The only difference is that when the body is not awake the production of chemicals that facilitate the
						movement of muscles is blocked. This is why you could be falling from a skyscraper and flailing your arms 
						in your dream, but in real life, maintain your sleeping position. When you wake up these chemicals start being produced once again.
						However, some people suffer the effects of their body malfunctioning this process. The first condition is that even when they wake up, the chemicals don't get 
						produced and as a result, they are paralyzed as they wake. Their eyes will be open but in a sense their body, is still in the dream.
						The 2nd type are the complete opposite and their bodies produce these muscles even in their sleep. This is what induces sleep-walking.
						These people will actually move around similar to their movement in the dream.</p>

					<p>Perhaps the most intriguing part of dreaming is lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming is a skill one can develop that allows the person to become 
					aware that they are dreaming. What this means is that the person has complete control over their &ldquo;dream&rdquo; body. They can fly, fight, swim
					and explore the world around them. Lucid dreaming has become so popular that e-courses and even pills have been crafted for lucid dreaming.</p>
