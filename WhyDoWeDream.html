					<p>The most famous theory is called the Information-processing of dreaming. It is believed that dreaming is just the brain trying to 
					make sense of memories during the day. So it weaves a story out of some of those memories that give the sensory experience of the dream.
					A dream is the by product of the processing of information done by the brain at night. This was theorized to be useful in early human times when humans 
					would get dreams of the hunt where it provided them aid for honing their skills.

					<p> There are similar but also totally different theories out there. Some scientists think dreaming is a way in which the brain cleanses it's drives.
					It collects the trash in one big flow of thought. That is what a dream is, according to some. Some theories state that external stimuli are major influence 
					in dreams. For example, if the person was sleeping next to a running fan, the wind and the noise will be incorporated in the dream. A contemporary model of the reason
					behind dreaming combines element of all of these models and theories.
